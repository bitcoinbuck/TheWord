The Bitcoin Buck Party Rules

Introduction

Bitcoin Buck is being actively developed to provide a bridge between the 'bitcoin core' code and the 'bitcoin unlimited' code while using KISS principles. Hence the name : Bitcoin BU on Core & Kiss == BitcoinBuck.

Goals

- Actively track & include all changes to 'bitcoin core' into this project.
- All changes should be as simple as possible (KISS). Try to not stray substancially from the core implementation to make merges easier. 
- Implement emergent consesus for core features that the 'core' team have decided should be under their direct control. This begins with blocksize but is not limited to that. 
- Release source code & executables for each major 'bitcoin core' release after version 0.12.
- Do not implement any of the other features included in any other bitcoin version or altcoin.
